# Detect anomalies in data streamed to "Maximo Asset Monitor"

In this Code Pattern we will show how to publish data stored within an Watson IOT Platform Analytics instance to an external service. Once the data is analyzed by the service, the results can then be persisted in the Analytics Platform database.

Our specific demonstrated use case here is to detect anomalies within a Maximo Asset Monitor dataset using a scikit-learn model, which is externally hosted in a Watson Machine Learning service. We'll also demonstrate how to visualize the anomalies over time via dashboards.

When the reader has completed this Code Pattern, they will understand how to:

* Load asset data into [Watson IOT Platform Analytics](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSQP8H/iot/analytics/as_overview.html).
* Forward data to external services via REST HTTP call.
* Build a dashboard using [Maximo Asset Monitor](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSQP8H/iot/monitor/index.html) to monitor, visualize, and analyze IOT asset data.
* Generate alerts when certain results are received.
<!-- * Deploy, schedule and run mycustom Python Functions in [Watson IOT Platform Analytics](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSQP8H/iot/analytics/as_overview.html) to retrieve data from Maximo every 5 minutes. -->

<!-- [IBM TRIRIGA Building Insights](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSQP8H/iot/analytics/as_overview.html) -->
<!-- * Define Assets in -->

The intended audience for this Code Pattern are developers / data scientists who would like to analyze their data in Watson IOT Platform Analytics via customized machine learning models that are hosted externally.

# Flow

1. IoT data is retrieved by function in Watson IOT Platform Analytics
2. Data is packaged as a dataframe and forwarded to a REST endpoint where custom model is hosted
3. Model results are retrieved and appended to dataset
4. Dataset is validated and committed to DB, alert is sent if anomaly is detected

<!-- 4. Schedule the function to collect asset data -->
<!-- 5. Create a Monitoring Dashboard to manage the asset -->
<!-- 6. View the Monitoring Dashboard with Building Energy Consumption -->

## 2. Setup your Python development environment

### Install Python

Clone this repository
```
git clone git@github.com:IBM/maximo-anomaly.git
cd maximo-anomaly
```

Instal virtualenv if you don't have it already
```
sudo pip install virtualenv
```

Create a virtual environment
```
python3 -m venv env
```
<!-- virtualenv -p python3 env -->

### Activate Virtual Environment, Install Python Dependencies and Verify Environment
Enter your Virtual Environment directory
```
cd env
```
Activate your virtual environment
```
source bin/activate
```


### Install dependencies
```
# Prereqs
pip install numpy
pip install sqlalchemy pandas ibm_db_sa urllib3 requests lxml sklearn ibm_db python-dotenv future

# Watson IOT Functions
pip install git+https://github.com/ibm-watson-iot/functions.git@production --upgrade
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Watson Machine Learning Client
pip install watson_machine_learning_client
```



<!-- * Apply fix for DYLD (OS X only)

```
# Navigate to your preferred python installation
cd /usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages

``` -->
<!--
* Install Watson IOT Functions dependencies:
```
pip install git+https://github.com/ibm-watson-iot/functions.git@production --upgrade
``` -->
<!-- * Set PYTHONPATH to your project directory:
```
export PYTHONPATH="<root_project_directory>"
``` -->
<!-- * Verify that you can invoke the `local_test_of_function.py` script
```
python ./scripts/local_test_of_function.py
``` -->

## 3. Leverage Python scripts to register entity, function, and ML model

Copy your Watson IOT Platform Service credentials into a `credentials.json` file

Navigate to your Watson IOT Platform Analytics service.

https://dashboard-us.connectedproducts.internetofthings.ibmcloud.com/preauth?tenantid=<tenant-id>

Services > Watson IOT Platform Analytics > View Details > Copy to clipboard

![credentials](./images/watson_iot_credentials.png)

If you've created a custom fork of this repo, modify your .custom/functions.py to set your PACKAGE_URL as the forked Github repository. This is necessary because the Analytics Service will need to install the custom function via pip.

`PACKAGE_URL = 'git+https://github.com/ibm/maximo-anomaly@'`

<!-- Change the class name if someone else has already published a function with the same name in your tenant function catalog. In this case, our class name is `InvokeExternalModel`.

```
class InvokeExternalModel(BasePreload):
``` -->

Set the PYTHONPATH to the root directory of this project

```
export PYTHONPATH=$(pwd)
```


Invoke the `register_entity.py` script. This script will create an Entity Type, and inject sample data for each metric column. This will also create an additional "anomaly_score" column where we can place the model results

```
python scripts/register_entity.py
```

After the entity has been registered, we'll run the following script to build and publish a model based off our custom data.

```
python scripts/register_model.py
```


The output of the previous command should include a "deployment_id" and a "model_id". Place these into your .env file as "WATSON_ML_DEPLOYMENT_ID" and "WATSON_ML_MODEL_ID".

After adding the WML credentials, we can test the registed function with the following command

```
python scripts/invoke_model_function.py
```


<!-- ```
python ./scripts/local_test_of_function.py
``` -->

## 4. Deploy Function
<!-- * Push function code changes to Github.
```
git add ./mycustom/functions.py
git commit -m "my function changes"
git push origin master
``` -->
Next, we'll add our custom function to our newly created entity via the UI. This will enable the selected function to run every 5 minutes and analyze new data for anomalies. To enable the function, navigate to the "Add Data view". We can get to this form in the Analytics dashboard by selecting the following

Monitor > Entity Types > (entity name) > Data
<!-- ![Select function](./images/create_new_data.png) -->

Click the `+` button and search for "InvokeModel"
<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Q0EzV37.png"/>
</p>


Enter the values/credentials for your Machine Learning instance. You can also specify which features to select.
- URL - WML Endpoint
- apikey - "WML API key"
- model_id - "WML Model ID (should be printed after running invoke_model_function.py)"
- deployment_id - "WML Deployment ID (should be printed after running invoke_model_function.py)"
- input_features - "comma separated list of features that should be loaded from entity dataframe"

<!-- - username	- "IBM Cloud username"
- password - "IBM Cloud password" -->

<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/bMzGOyt.png"/>
</p>


Then enter an output variable name and click "Create". The output variable is a boolean value indicating whether the function completed successfully.

<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/lWDsmKP.png"
</p>

In summary, the registered function will check for new data from the associated enitity instances every five minutes. The relevant columns (input_features) in the newly added data is then forwarded to the external ML model, and the result is stored in the "anomaly_results" column of the dataframe.


## 5. Add alerts

We can also Leverage the "Alerts" feature to receive notifications as anomalies are detected. We'll do so here by clicking the `+` button in the Entity view, and then selecting the "AlertExpression" function

<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/7Mnuqu7.png"/>
</p>

Then, enter a condition indicating when the Alert should be triggered. In this case, we should get an alert whenever our anomaly score value is below 0. Enter an output value (using "anomaly_detected" here) and click next.

<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/UzJQIoC.png"/>
</p>

We can then see a list of all anomalies by selecting our "anomaly_detected" variable.

<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/2Zjs4wu.png" />
</p>


<!-- ![credentials](./images/function-tenant.png) -->


## 6. Add Dashboard Visualizations

We can also generate visualizations for each entity instance, which can help identify high level patterns in a dataset. This is done by selecting one of the records in the "instance dashboards" table


<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/VZQ7TES.png"/>
</p>

Next, click the gear icon in the upper right, and select "Edit Dashboard"
<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/zmyCdqY.png"/>
</p>

Click "Import"
<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/zmyCdqY.png"/>
</p>

Select the json file in `dashboards/speed_line_dashboard.json`

This will show an overview of instance data for any particular entity.

<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/6hG59sK.png"/>
</p>


Metrics can be added to the chart by adding objects to the content and dataSource arrays in the [dashboards/anomalyInstanceDashboard.json](dashboards/anomalyInstanceDashboard.json) file
```
{
    "dataSourceId": "<metric_name>",
    "label": "<metric_name>"
}

...

{
    "aggregator": "max",
    "attribute": "<metric_name>",
    "id": "<metric_name>"
},
```

<!-- ## 6. Update Function (Optional)

If you're interested in modifying the type of model,

In our case, we first added methods to query the Maximo api
```
def getBuildings (self ):
    q_endpoint = self.url + "/maximo/oslc/os/mxasset?oslc.select=assetid&oslc.where=assettag=" + "BUILDING"
    headers = { "maxauth": self.token }
    res = requests.get(q_endpoint, headers=headers)
    return buildings
```

```
def getMeters (self, asset_id = None):
    # hardcoding id for test TODO
    asset_id = "2112"
    q_endpoint = self.url + "/maximo/oslc/os/mxasset?oslc.select=assetmeter&oslc.where=assetnum=" + asset_id
    headers = { "maxauth": self.token }
    res = requests.get(q_endpoint, headers=headers)
    meters = []
    try:
        meters = res.json()["rdfs:member"][0]["spi:assetmeter"]
        print(str(len(meters)) + " meters found")
    except:
        print("no meters found")
        pass
    return meters
```
These methods query the Maximo OSLC api to receive all buildings and meters that are associated with an Asset derived from the "Building" template

Next, we added these mycustom methods to the main `execute` method. The result of each method is then loaded into a `response_data` dictionary as a numpy array.

```
buildings = self.getBuildings()
response_data['building'] = np.array(buildings)
..
..
meterValues = self.getMeters()
response_data['temperature'] = np.array(meterValues)
``` -->
<!-- * Update function input arguments in your Buildings Entity Type (if applicable)
```
Explore > Entity Types > Buildings > output_item > configure > next > update
``` -->

<!-- ![dashboard](./images/dashboard.png) -->
